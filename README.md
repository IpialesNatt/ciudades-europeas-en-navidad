# ciudades-europeas-en-navidad
https://dribbble.com/shots/23450645-ATIRA-Animation was the page used to hepl design our web page
This is the first entry of the project to be completed in December. It is a project that seeks to publicize different European cities during the most endearing time for many people, Christmas.
The file is developed with HTML and CSS tools, and a framework library was used to place the contact icons with the creators of the page. 

It is a simple website, with a menu that can take you to see up to 3 cities at Christmas time. It is a way to show the user quickly and intuitively how Christmas is celebrated in these cities.
First of all, we have the main page, where we have placed a background image in the h1 text, to which we have also applied a pading so that the image adjusts to our needs. 

A brief description helps us understand the content of the page and then we have 3 links to each of the cities that have been chosen for the project. 
Next, we place 3 images that will help us visually show each of the cities that we are going to show on the website. 

Each link leads to a page of a different city, whose structure is:
Headed with the name of the city and a background representative of the city at Christmas time. 
1. An introduction section of the most relevant things about each city
2. A photo gallery of each relevant place in that city accompanied by a short description of it.

The program has been created using visual studio code, with the W3C validation, XML and XML tolds extensions.
